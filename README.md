# draw-visualizer
> ⚠️ **THIS PROJECT IS A WIP AND VERY UNSTABLE!** ⚠️

Roblox plugin heavily inspired by the [osu!framework draw visualizer](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/wiki/Debug-Overlays:-Draw-Visualizer). This is a plugin that aims to enable speedy traversal of your UI hierarchy and modification of properties without having to use the default Explorer and Properties windows.


### recent demo (very buggy):

UI is written in [Blend](https://quenty.github.io/NevermoreEngine/api/Blend) (included in Quenty's [NevermoreEngine](https://github.com/Quenty/NevermoreEngine))
